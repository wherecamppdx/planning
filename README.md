# WhereCampPDX Planning

An issues-only repository for planning [WhereCampPDX](http://wherecamppdx.org)

WhereCamps are unconferences that aim to connect geo-enthusiasts, developers, social place hackers, artists, activists, grad students, geographers, earth scientists and anybody else who wants to "know their place".

Popular topics include social cartography, software and hardware, context awareness, mobile experimentation, humanitarian mapping efforts, food webs and local food transparency, transit, psychogeography, geo games, paper maps, and place hacking.
